On March 29, Chicago will enter Covid vaccine [phase 1C](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/sites/covid19-vaccine/home/vaccine-distribution-phases.html). This phase will include most Chicago residents, such as those working in retail, media, IT, communications, and real estate. There’s a good write-up on the current state of the vaccination effort [here](https://thetriibe.com/2021/03/most-chicagoans-will-be-eligible-for-vaccine-beginning-march-29-but-not-everyone-will-be-able-to-get-vaccinated-immediately/). All that said, many could likely get vaccinated before the mentioned date via one of the following methods:

- Call your primary care physician or main clinic, they may have extra vaccines or may have had appointment cancellations.
- Join the [Chicago Vaccine Hunters Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1864372350383607/) — members post ways of getting appointments there regularly (including when particular websites get more appointments).
- For a thorough list of ways to get vaccinated, check the [alternatives and additional information on this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQ9rQdqgSJFapWJCKHA6ERzTva0W82DiEHKzG5AWkCNCaXwgwZOIgoIcN4gsdjgQr8doMLPRTfrLV_L/pubhtml?fbclid=IwAR1kxS9OC6uyiUo7H_ZAa13dXpP8rJ9rcxMdIHMKYljtl9BtS_deg3J4yjU#). Some alternatives have appointments posted sporadically throughout the day, others allow you to choose from a calendar of available appointment dates, and some will reach out to you once you're eligible.
- The [Chicago Vaccine Angels](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdreIEPhQBy8vXsW60jogNqmjy16SO9OzV39hT_v5NRaSTzYA/viewform) are also accepting requests to help you find a vaccine. Please read the form fully about what phases the group is helping folks with as well as what information they'll need.

Good luck out there!
