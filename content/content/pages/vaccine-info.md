On March 29 Chicago entered Covid vaccine [phase 1C](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/sites/covid19-vaccine/home/vaccine-distribution-phases.html) which made all essential workers and adults with underlying medical conditions eligible for COVID-19 vaccines. On April 12, vaccines will technically be made available to any [Illinois resident](https://coronavirus.illinois.gov/s/). This means that vaccines appointments may be difficult to get during April in Chicago.

Given the high demand consider these methods for getting a Covid vaccine:

- Call your primary care physician or main clinic, they may have extra vaccines or may have had appointment cancellations.
- Join the [Chicago Vaccine Hunters Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1864372350383607/) ‚Äî members post ways of getting appointments there regularly (including when particular websites get more appointments).
- An [Illinois Vaccine Alert account on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ilvaccinealerts) has been created you can follow.
- Check out the list of appointments in Cook County by a volunteer-run [site](https://www.ilvaccine.org/) for Illinois residents
- Check out [Vaccine Spotter](https://www.vaccinespotter.org/IL/) which is [open source](https://github.com/getaaron/vaccine-spotter/)
- Check out the [locations registered by the State of Illinois](https://coronavirus.illinois.gov/s/vaccination-location) that distribute vaccines
- If you are unable to book an appointment on [Zocdoc](zocdoc.com/vaccine) for the [United Center](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/sites/covid19-vaccine/home/united-center.html), call the United Center hotline (312) 746-4835 (This call center will be available from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday through Saturday and 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Sunday.)
